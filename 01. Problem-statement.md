# **1. Problem Statement for GitHub Actions (Why GA Exists?)**

Modern software teams need to deliver applications **faster, safer, and continuously**, but they struggle because:

### **1.1 Code changes must reach production quickly**

Teams push code daily, sometimes multiple times.
But manual deployment steps cause:

* Delays
* Inconsistency
* Human errors
* Environment drift

### **1.2 CI/CD tools must integrate tightly with GitHub**

Most development teams use GitHub, but external CI/CD tools require:

* Extra setup
* Extra servers
* Credentials management
* Webhooks
* Synchronization

This increases complexity.

### **1.3 Developers want automation at the code level**

Developers prefer automation that runs **on every push, pull request, tag, or schedule**
→ Traditional tools are not natively integrated.

### **1.4 Infrastructure management is becoming a burden**

Tools like Jenkins require:

* Installing servers
* Managing plugins
* Scaling agents
* Maintaining security patches

Teams want **serverless, auto-scale CI/CD**.

### **1.5 Polyglot applications need flexible pipelines**

Modern teams use:

* Java
* Python
* Node
* ML workflows
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* IaC (Terraform / Ansible)

They need pipelines that support **multiple languages and container workflows** easily.

# **2. Challenges With Traditional CI/CD Tools (Jenkins, GitLab Runner, Bamboo, TeamCity)**

Below are the issues that GitHub Actions tries to solve.

---

## **2.1 Infrastructure Overhead**

Traditional tools require:

* Machines/VMs
* Jenkins masters/slaves
* Runner servers
* Load balancers
* Backups

You have to maintain everything.

✔ Costly
✔ Time-consuming
✔ Requires DevOps team

---

## **2.2 Plugin & Dependency Hell**

In Jenkins:

* 1000+ plugins
* Plugins break after updates
* Plugin compatibility issues
* Manual plugin upgrades

This creates maintenance headaches.

---

## **2.3 Scaling Issues**

When multiple developers trigger builds:

* Jenkins queues jobs
* Runners become overloaded
* Need to manually increase agents

GitHub Actions provides **auto-scaling runners**.

---

## **2.4 Weak GitHub Integration**

Jenkins and others need:

* Webhooks
* Personal Access Tokens
* Webhook secret management
* Permissions setup

This increases security and operational workload.

GitHub Actions is **built inside GitHub**, so no extra integration needed.

---

## **2.5 High Setup Effort**

To set up Jenkins:

1. Install Jenkins
2. Install Java
3. Configure plugins
4. Configure pipelines
5. Configure credentials
6. Setup agents
7. Setup GitHub webhooks

This takes hours to days.

GitHub Actions needs only:
**A `.github/workflows/*.yml` file** → Done.

---

## **2.6 Limited Cloud-Native Support**

Traditional tools struggle with:

* Kubernetes deployments
* Docker image building
* IaC automation
* Microservices pipelines
* Container-based runners

GitHub Actions offers:

* Prebuilt actions
* Cloud-native runners
* Docker-based job execution
* Built-in container registry (GHCR)

---

## **2.7 Security Challenges**

Traditional CI/CD tools require:

* Managing SSH keys
* Managing PATs
* Securing Jenkins master
* Managing secrets manually

GitHub Actions has:

* GitHub Secrets
* OIDC authentication
* Encrypted secrets storage
* Environment protection rules

---

## **2.8 Lack of Developer-Friendly Pipelines**

With tools like Jenkins, pipeline-as-code is YAML or Groovy:

* Complex
* Not beginner-friendly
* Hard to debug

GitHub Actions YAML is:

* Clean
* Simple
* Developer-focused

---

# **3. Why GitHub Actions is Needed**

GitHub Actions solves the above issues by providing:

### **✔ Serverless CI/CD**

No servers, no agents, no infrastructure.

### **✔ Native GitHub integration**

Runs automatically on:

* Push
* PR
* Tag
* Release
* Issues
* Schedules
* Environment events

### **✔ Easy pipeline as code**

Just create a file:
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### **✔ Reusable, shareable Actions**

Marketplace has **20,000+ actions**.

### **✔ Secure**

* Built-in secrets
* OIDC cloud authentication
* Least privilege workflows
* Environment approvals

### **✔ Scales automatically**

GitHub manages runners.

### **✔ Supports everything**

* DevOps
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* ML/AI pipelines
* Terraform
* Testing (JUnit, PyTest, Cypress)
* Multi-language support

# **4. Final Problem Statement Summary (Best for Presentation Slide)**

> **“Teams need fast, automated, secure, and developer-friendly CI/CD pipelines integrated with GitHub.
> Traditional tools are slow, complex, infrastructure-heavy, and require high maintenance. GitHub Actions solves this by providing a fully managed, GitHub-native, scalable, and flexible CI/CD platform.”**

## What are Actions in GitHub Actions?

Actions are reusable tasks that you can use inside a workflow.
They are like small modules that perform a specific job.

Instead of writing long shell scripts, you can use an action to do the same work in one line.

For example:
checkout code
setup languages
upload files
download artifacts
login to cloud
build docker image
run test tools

These common tasks are already created by GitHub or the community.
You just reuse them.

## Types of Actions

There are three types.

1. GitHub official actions
   These are created and maintained by GitHub.
   Example: actions/checkout, actions/setup-java

2. Community actions
   These are created by other developers and shared in GitHub Marketplace.

3. Custom actions
   You can create your own actions for repeated tasks.

## Where to find Actions

You can search for actions in the GitHub Marketplace.
Go to: [https://github.com/marketplace/actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions)

There you can find actions for AWS, Azure, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Slack, Python, Node, Java, and many others.

## How to use an Action

In your workflow, you use the keyword "uses".

Example:

```
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

Format:
owner/repository@version

Example:
actions/checkout@v4

2. Reduces code in workflow
3. Easy to reuse
4. Easy for beginners
5. No need to write complex scripts
6. Standard and reliable

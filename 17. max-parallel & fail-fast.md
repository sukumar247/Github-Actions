Both are very important for controlling how matrix jobs run.

============================================================

# max-parallel: Explanation

Definition
`max-parallel` controls **how many matrix jobs are allowed to run at the same time**.

If your matrix produces 10 jobs, but you set:

```
max-parallel: 2
```

Then only **2 jobs will run at a time**.
The remaining 8 jobs will wait in a queue.

Why we use max-parallel

1. To reduce load on GitHub runners
2. To stay within company runner limits
3. To avoid hitting API rate limits
4. To reduce cost (self-hosted runners)
5. To sequentially control heavy jobs like Docker builds, DB tests, etc.

Example understanding
Matrix jobs = 6
max-parallel = 2

Job 1 & Job 2 start
When one finishes → Job 3 starts
When another finishes → Job 4 starts
And so on…

It provides **parallel control**.

============================================================

# fail-fast: Explanation

Definition
`fail-fast` decides **what to do when one of the matrix jobs fails**.

Two modes:

Mode 1: fail-fast: true (default behavior)

* If one matrix job fails
* GitHub cancels all remaining matrix jobs immediately
* Workflow stops early

Use case:
When you do not want to waste time.
If one version fails, you assume others may also fail.

Mode 2: fail-fast: false

* Even if one job fails
* Other matrix jobs will still run
* No cancellation
* You get full test coverage

Example understanding
Matrix = 6 jobs
Job 2 fails

fail-fast: true

* Jobs 3, 4, 5, 6 will be cancelled
* Workflow stops early

fail-fast: false

* Jobs 3, 4, 5, 6 will continue
* Workflow completes fully
* You get complete results for all versions

============================================================

# Combined Example

```
strategy:
  max-parallel: 2
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    version: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Explanation:

max-parallel: 2
Only 2 jobs run at a time.

fail-fast: false
Even if version 2 fails, versions 3, 4, 5 will still run.

============================================================

## When to use fail-fast true

Small test matrix
Not much difference between cases
Fast feedback required
Non-critical testing

## When to use fail-fast false

Large matrix (OS + versions)
You want full test coverage
Multi-platform compatibility testing
Production pipelines
Education/training demos

============================================================

# Simple Final Summary

max-parallel controls *how many* matrix jobs run at once.
fail-fast controls *whether to cancel* remaining jobs when one fails.

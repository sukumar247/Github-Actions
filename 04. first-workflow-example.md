# ✔️ KK FUNDA — Create & Run First Workflow (Beginner Level — Only Linux Commands)

This is exactly suitable for starting-level training.

---

# **1. Creating Your First Workflow**

In your repository, create this file:

```
.github/workflows/first.yml
```

Add the simplest workflow:

```yaml
name: First Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:   #runs the workflow manually

jobs:
  basic-demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Say Hello
        run: echo "Hello from KK FUNDA"

      - name: Show Linux version
        run: uname -a

      - name: List current directory
        run: ls -ltr

      - name: Print current user
        run: whoami

      - name: Print date and time
        run: date
```

### **Concepts Explained**

* `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` → GitHub provides a fresh Linux machine
* `run:` → shell commands
* Output visible in Actions logs

**This is the cleanest way to start GitHub Actions teaching.**

---

# **2. Opening VS Code via `https://github.dev/`**

This is perfect for beginners.

### **How to open?**

From any GitHub repo:

* Press `.` (dot) on the keyboard
  **OR**
* Change URL

  ```
  github.com/<user>/<repo> → github.dev/<user>/<repo>
  ```

You will see **VS Code UI** inside your browser.

### **Why use `github.dev`?**

* No installation
* Works on mobile, laptop, office system
* Perfect to create `.github/workflows/` folder easily
* Great for teaching beginners how to edit YAML

### **What to do here?**

* Create folder: `.github/workflows/`
* Add YAML file: `first.yml`
* Commit the file from the left menu
* Workflow will automatically trigger

---

# **3. Installing GitHub Actions Plugin (for VS Code users)**

If students use Desktop VS Code:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions
3. Search: **GitHub Actions**
4. Install the official extension
5. It provides:

   * Syntax highlighting
   * Autocomplete for YAML
   * Easy workflow navigation

Note:
Some features will not work in **github.dev**, but syntax support works.

# **4. Multiple Simple Basic Workflows (Ubuntu + Linux Commands Only)**

Here is the **pure basics** version — no projects, no code, no languages.

---

## **Workflow 1 — Print system info**

```yaml
name: System Info

on: [push]

jobs:
  info:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print hostname
        run: hostname

      - name: Kernel info
        run: uname -r

      - name: Show OS info
        run: cat /etc/os-release
```

## **Workflow 2 — File and directory operations**

```yaml

jobs:
  files:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create file
        run: echo "KK FUNDA TEST FILE" > demo.txt

      - name: Show file content
        run: cat demo.txt

      - name: List directory
        run: ls -l
```

---

## **Workflow 3 — Environment variables**

```yaml
name: Env Demo

on: [push]

  env-demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Print predefined env
        run: echo "Repo Name is $GITHUB_REPOSITORY"

      - name: Set and print custom env
        run: |
          MYNAME="Prashanth"
          echo "My name is $MYNAME"
```

---

## **Workflow 4 — Using multiple steps with Linux commands**

```yaml
name: Multi-Step Demo

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step 1 - pwd
        run: pwd

      - name: Step 2 - whoami
        run: whoami

      - name: Step 3 - System date
        run: date

      - name: Step 4 - Disk usage
        run: df -h
```

## **Workflow 5 — Simple string manipulation**

```yaml
name: Strings Demo

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  strings:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Convert to uppercase
        run: echo "kk funda" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

```

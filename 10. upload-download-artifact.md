upload-artifact and download-artifact in GitHub Actions

---

Artifacts are files generated during a workflow run.
Examples: log files, test reports, output files, text files, shell script outputs, build results etc.

GitHub Actions provides two actions for handling artifacts:

1. upload-artifact
   Used to upload files from the runner to GitHub.

2. download-artifact
   Used to download previously uploaded files in the same workflow or another workflow.

These two features help store and share files produced during automation.

---

## Why artifacts are required

The runner machine is temporary.
After the workflow finishes, the runner and all files inside it are deleted.

If you want to keep any file after the run, you must upload it as an artifact.

Example uses:
Saving logs
Saving configuration files
Saving test reports
Saving generated output
Saving build results
Debugging failed workflows

---

## upload-artifact

This action uploads files from the runner to GitHub so you can download them later.

Syntax:

```
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
with:
  name: any-name
  path: file or folder path
```

name
Logical name given to artifact.
path
Actual file or folder that should be uploaded.

---

## Example: Uploading a single file

Assume your script creates a file output.txt.

Workflow:

```
steps:
  - name: Create file
    run: echo "Hello from KK FUNDA" > output.txt

  - name: Upload file
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: my-output
      path: output.txt
```

After workflow finishes:
Go to Actions
Select the run
You will see artifact: my-output
Download it to your system.

---

## Example: Uploading multiple files

```
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
with:
  name: logs
  path: |
    log1.txt
    log2.txt
    logs-folder/
```

path supports multiple lines.

---

## Example: Uploading entire folder

```
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
with:
  name: reports
  path: reports/
```

Even a folder will be zipped and stored as artifact.

---

## download-artifact

This action downloads previously uploaded artifacts.

Syntax:

```
uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
with:
  name: artifact-name
```

After download, the artifact will be placed in the working directory of the runner.

---

## Sequential example

Job 1 uploads artifact
Job 2 downloads artifact

```
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create file
        run: echo "Data file" > data.txt

      - name: Upload file
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: datafile
          path: data.txt

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - name: Download file
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: datafile

      - name: Show file content
        run: cat data.txt
```

Explanation
Job1 runs and uploads data.txt
Job2 waits for job1
Job2 downloads data.txt into the working directory
cat displays file content

---

## Using download-artifact without specifying name

If your workflow has only one artifact uploaded:

```
uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
```

All artifacts will be downloaded automatically.

---

## Where artifacts are stored

Artifacts are stored inside GitHub under the workflow run.
Retention period can be configured (default 90 days).

---

## Best practices

Always use clear names for artifacts
Example: unit-test-report, build-output, logs

Upload only needed files
Do not upload huge folders unnecessarily

Use sequential jobs when one job requires artifact from another

---

## One line definition

upload-artifact saves files from the runner
download-artifact retrieves those files again
